![Screenshot](screenshot.png "EmbarkFromAnyTown Mod")
This is an Against the Storm mod that allows embarking from any existing settlement.

## Installation

This mod requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) to be installed. Simply download the loader and unzip it into your game directory.

The `.dll` file created by this mod (`Rodikh.ATS.EmbarkFromAnyTown.dll` by default) can then be dropped into the `BepInEx\plugins` subdirectory inside the game directory. You might have to make this directory yourself, or run the game once to have it made automatically.
